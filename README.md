SRGAN and ESRGAN-based Super-Resolution on DIV2K
Tasks 1 and 2 — AI Project by Vighnesh Nama

📋 Project Description
This project is divided into two major tasks:


Task | Description
Task 1 | Implementation and reproduction of the original SRGAN model on the DIV2K dataset.
Task 2 | Enhancement of the baseline model by integrating ESRGAN techniques (Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks, PSNR/SSIM evaluation, etc.).

🧪 Task 1: SRGAN Reproduction
Objective: Faithfully reproduce the SRGAN model (Ledig et al., 2017) on the DIV2K dataset.

Training Setup:

Dataset: DIV2K

Epochs: 50

Batch size: 16

Crop size: 96×96

Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4)

Results after 50 epochs:

PSNR: 8.78 dB

SSIM: 0.063

Challenges:

Limited training epochs compared to original paper (~100k iterations).

GPU memory constraints.

🧪 Task 2: ESRGAN-Style Enhancement
Objective: Improve SRGAN by:

Replacing generator with ESRGAN's RRDB (Residual-in-Residual Dense Block).

Adding per-epoch PSNR and SSIM evaluation.

Optimizing batch size and crop size for GPU constraints.

Training Setup:

Dataset: DIV2K

Epochs: 100

Batch size: 8 (adjusted)

Crop size: 64×64 (adjusted)

Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4)

Best Results:

Peak PSNR: 13.5 dB

Peak SSIM: 0.30

Challenges:

Training ESRGAN-style deeper networks on limited resources.

Managing perceptual loss vs PSNR trade-offs.
