📋 Project Description
This project is divided into two major tasks:


Task | Description
Task 1 | Implementation and reproduction of the original SRGAN model on the DIV2K dataset.
Task 2 | Enhancement of the baseline model by integrating ESRGAN techniques (Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks, PSNR/SSIM evaluation, etc.).

🧪 Task 1: SRGAN Reproduction
Objective: Faithfully reproduce the SRGAN model (Ledig et al., 2017) on the DIV2K dataset.

Training Setup:

Dataset: DIV2K
Epochs: 50
Batch size: 16
Crop size: 96×96
Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4)

Results after 50 epochs:
PSNR: 8.78 dB
SSIM: 0.063

Challenges:
Limited training epochs compared to original paper (~100k iterations).
GPU memory constraints.

🧪 Task 2: ESRGAN-Style Enhancement
Objective: Improve SRGAN by:
Replacing generator with ESRGAN's RRDB (Residual-in-Residual Dense Block).
Adding per-epoch PSNR and SSIM evaluation.
Optimizing batch size and crop size for GPU constraints.

Training Setup:
Dataset: DIV2K
Epochs: 100
Batch size: 8 (adjusted)
Crop size: 64×64 (adjusted)
Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4)

Best Results:
Peak PSNR: 13.5 dB
Peak SSIM: 0.30

Challenges:
Training ESRGAN-style deeper networks on limited resources.
Managing perceptual loss vs PSNR trade-offs.

📈 Task 1 vs Task 2: SRGAN vs ESRGAN Model Comparison
This section highlights the improvements between the baseline SRGAN (Task 1) and the enhanced ESRGAN (Task 2) models based on architecture, training setup, and quantitative performance metrics.

🧠 Architectural Differences
Feature | Task 1: SRGAN | Task 2: ESRGAN
Generator Architecture | Deep ResNet (Residual Blocks with BN) | Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB)
Discriminator | Standard CNN-based discriminator | Same as Task 1
Loss Functions | Pixel Loss + VGG Content Loss + Adversarial Loss | Improved Perceptual Loss + Adversarial Loss
Batch Normalization | Present in generator | Removed in generator

Parameter | Task 1: SRGAN | Task 2: ESRGAN
Batch Size | 16 | 4
HR Patch Size | 96×96 pixels | 48×48 pixels
Learning Rate | 1e-4 | 2e-4
Epochs | 50 | 100
Dataset | DIV2K | DIV2K
Data Augmentation | Random flips, rotations | Random flips, rotations

📈 Performance Metrics (Validation Set)
Metric | Task 1: SRGAN (after 50 epochs) | Task 2: ESRGAN (after 100 epochs)
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) | 8.78 dB | 13.5 dB
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) | 0.063 | 0.300

📝 Observations
Visual Quality:
ESRGAN produces sharper, more detailed textures compared to SRGAN's smooth outputs.

Training Stability:
Removing BatchNorm layers in ESRGAN helped stabilize training and avoid artifacts.

Metric Improvement:
ESRGAN achieved significantly higher PSNR and SSIM, indicating better reconstruction quality.

Resource Trade-offs:
Due to ESRGAN's heavier model, batch size and patch size had to be reduced to fit GPU memory (Tesla T4).

Training Duration:
Doubling the training epochs (50 → 100) in Task 2 contributed to improved convergence.
